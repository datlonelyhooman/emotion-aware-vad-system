# Emotion-Aware Voice Activity Detection System

This project implements a multi-phase machine learning pipeline for detecting voice activity
and predicting emotional states from audio signals.

## Features
- Audio feature extraction (MFCC-based)
- Emotion classification using ML models
- Batch and single-file inference
- Command-line interface (CLI)
- Streamlit-based demo interface

## Project Structure
- `src/` – Feature extraction, inference logic, and CLI
- `models/` – Trained ML models
- `data/` – Sample audio files

## Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy, Librosa, Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
